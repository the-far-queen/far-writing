# far-writing

**novels, articles, ebooks, copy. Voice is the gate; prompt is not.**

novels, articles, long-form ebooks, marketing copy, transcripts, scripts, the writing pipeline.

## What this repo is

- A free, public-domain substrate for the voice pipeline.
- A gate (voice schema) that no asset enters without axes.
- A growing library of voices.

## What this repo is not

- A prompt collection. (Prompts are noise without axes.)
- A house-style. (The whole point is *named* voice, not default look.)
- A model zoo. (Models belong upstream; we use the open ones.)

## AGENTS.md

The schema lives in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md). Read it first. The axes
are the contract.
